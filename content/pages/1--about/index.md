Hi! I'm Anne Asis, a newly-minted graduate of Medicine going through a life transition. 

As dynamic and as varied as this phase of my life, this blog will be as I go through experiences, sharing anecdotes about my patients, expressing my frustrations and aspirations about the Philippine healthcare system, learning new things about applications of data science in improving health and in policy making, and practicing to write articles better.
