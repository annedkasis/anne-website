An enticing number if in pesos, or as number of likes for a witty tweet.

But these were unfortunately 21,729 steps I took for the entire 1,440 minutes of my last duty as a Neurosurgery intern.

### 0 steps
 
Prior to my duty, I downloaded the Pedometer Step Counter app (which has a really nice interface and is pretty accurate) because I wanted to have an objective measure of how much I move around, especially that my previous two duties in the same week were physically draining. In addition, my boyfriend shared to me some words from an influencer that in order to develop discipline in meeting objectives (e.g. fitness goal), integration in daily lives is important. Hence, I decided to use the app that day to also see how many calories I burned during work.

At the strike of 7am, as I was walking on my way to the hospital, I was checking the numbers moving as fast as my feet. Then as I reached our callroom on that windy and rainy Saturday of August 11th, work began.
 
### 2000 steps
 
Before the neurosurgeons went to the ER to do their morning rounds, I was tasked to search around the chaos for patients' charts, begging for them from nurses and residents, met with a few "siguraduhin mong ibabalik mo yan" here and there. Finding charts in the ER was like digging for million year old fossils in Mindanao valleys. Having them in my arms as I wait for the residents felt like holding treasures and I was greedy of them especially when residents wanted to borrow them. No, this is my task. Please don't take them from me.
 
An hour passed and I checked my phone again, it was already at the 2000th bar, 1/3 of the daily goal. Somehow, I developed some sense of pride that I took so many steps in that span of time, even sharing the screenshot to my boyfriend and my mother. I thought that if I could take on 2,000, I definitely could endure 50,000. It made me want to move along.

*"Pls make a CT scan request and give it to me at Ward 11. Salamat."*

*"Pls go the the OR to get the specimen and send it to the lab."*

*"Ann, asan na yung CT plates ni..."*

*"Pakuha naman ng blood ni..."*

*"Meet tayo sa blood bank tapos padala ng dugo sa OR. Slamat ann."*

*"Asan ka? Pacheck naman CSF results ni...*"*
 
It was already past my daily goal when I next checked my phone. I was happy for a few seconds because of the confettis of congratulations on my phone screen, but my mood went down along with the confettis.
 
Is this really an achievement?
 
### 12,000 steps
 
I no longer had sense of time at this point. Was it already night time? I had no idea, but I remember only having short breaks. Thankfully, it was the birthday of one of the clerks on duty so we celebrated with ice cream. As soon as I finished my cup of Double Dutch, the hustle continued.
 
The CT scan request was not approved.
 
What? Why would they deprive an emergency patient of one of the means of knowing the extent of the injury? How would the surgeons know where they'd draw on the patient's skull before they cut it open?
 
*"Akin na request. Ako na magpapaapprove."*
 
Yeah, sir, because it's your job in the first place. I went with him only to witness a heated argument between residents. We are talking about saving a patient's life, aren't we? What's there to argue about? The time is ticking and we've taken far too many steps. Please, just save the patient's life.
 
### 14,000 steps
 
Finally, CT imaging was done and the patient can be brought to the OR upstairs but no manongs were available to bring the patient and the oxygen tank. As much as I wanted to try to do it alone, it was physically not possible.
 
I phoned the operating room's nurse and asked for help and to my demise he said, "Ma'am, yung sinusundo lang po ng manong ay Pay patients. Pag Charity kayo po talaga mag-aakyat. Hanap nalang kayo diyan." At that point, I wanted to cry. Everyone is full of bullshit.
 
### 19,000 steps
 
*"I-admit mo na yung patient sa ward ASAP."*
 
I didn't reply. It's his job. I was already exhausted of going up and down the stairs for 6 levels, and I no longer felt sorry that he never has time to go home to his wife and son. I no longer wanted to help him because I felt used. I already felt sick and feverish, maybe from the fatigue from taking thousands of steps from my sanity.
 
Then, as we were waiting for blood to be processed outside the Blood Bank around 30 minutes past midnight, he talked.
 
*"Bakit kaya ganito ang sistema? Ang dami ko nang nakaaway at ang daming pagsisinungaling para lang magpaapprove ng mga bagay. Mismong pagkuha ng dugo para sa dinudugong pasyente, pahirapan pa. Hindi naman para sa amin tong ginagawa namin."*
 
Unfortunately, my mind and body could only take enough. I could not even say anything, silenced by a mixture of guilt, sadness, sympathy, anger.
 
Health is supposed to be a right.
 
### 21,729 steps
 
There's this long-running irony that healthcare workers put their own healths at risk while caring for another's health. Everyday, an intern could be taking at least 21,729 steps unknowingly, because of the inefficiencies of finding charts, sending specimens, getting blood, requesting for imaging, and all other scutwork that could have been done without even lifting one's butt from a chair.
 
Did I learn anything about the brain during this rotation about dealing with brains?
 
No, because I did not use my brain. I used my feet. ðŸ‘£
